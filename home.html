                    My dream came true when I constructed my own café, 
                    fulfilling my lifelong ambition of opening a coffee 
                    shop that would captivate and delight customers. It 
                    all began when I was assigned the task of creating 
                    a 3D model for my architecture class, and it was a 
                    no-brainer for me to choose to construct a café called 
                    "Kapehan Sa South." Little did I know that a few years 
                    later, destiny would bring me together with my girlfriend, 
                    who shared the same passion for exploring different 
                    cafes and indulging in the pleasure of coffee. Inspired by 
                    our mutual love for coffee and the desire to share 
                    that joy with others, we contemplated the idea of 
                    starting a cafe ourselves. However, being new to the 
                    business realm, we had to embark on a humble journey 
                    of knowledge acquisition, starting from scratch and 
                    eagerly absorbing every bit of information we could 
                    find. As an architect, I drew upon my expertise and 
                    renamed the café in alignment with my architectural 
                    company, "A.M. Design and Build," infusing the essence 
                    of our shared passion and vocation into the café's very 
                    identity. Through dedication and perseverance, we 
                    meticulously crafted a warm and inviting atmosphere 
                    at "Kapehan sa South," where coffee aficionados can 
                    savor every sip, enveloped in the welcoming embrace 
                    of our carefully curated ambiance and menu. Opening 
                    this café has been the realization of my dreams, a 
                    testament to the power of passion and the fulfillment 
                    that comes with transforming aspirations into reality.
